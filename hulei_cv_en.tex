\cventry{\bfseries 04/2012--Present}{\textit{VMKernel Native Device Driver Model} Testing}{}{}{\textit{VMware}}{\textbf{Platform}: \textit{ESX/VMKernel} and \textit{Linux} \hfill \textbf{Development Languages}: \textit{C/SHELL/SCons}}
%\cvitem{}{Due to some historical reasons, \textit{VMware}'s start-from-scratch OS the \textit{ESX/VMKernel} supports linux device drivers. A mid-layer called \textit{VMKLinux} was implemented to mimic the linux kernel environment, which servers as a broker between the \textit{VMKernel} and linux drivers. Such a design has serious performance and security drawbacks intrinsically. Finally we decided to embrace our own device driver model as well as device driver APIs which bypasses \textit{VMKLinux} and stands natively on \textit{VMKernel} in this release. By the mean time, we can't just simply throw away all linux drivers in only one release, so this model can also tolerate the original \textit{VMKLinux} model. That is the \textit{Native Driver Model}.}
\cvitem{}{\textit{Native Driver Model} is a device/driver management model designed particularly for \textit{VMKernel} in this release. For backward compatibility, it is able to co-exist with the previous \textit{VMKLinux} model derived from \textit{Linux}. Mainly this model contains 4 parts: the driver management model, the device management model which supports async event-driven device hotplug/unplug, the device-driver mapping mechanism and the device naming alias mechanism.}
%\cvitem{}{\hspace*{1em} There are 4 engineers for testing the whole model. My part is the mapping mechanism and the device naming alias mechanism. For such a purpose, I implemented pseudo PCI and logical devices, plus several dummy testing drivers including both native and \textit{VMKLinux} ones for them as test stubs. Plus a control module which was able to accept userland instructions and then dispatch them to test drivers, control of the construction of test scenarios from userland became pretty straightforward. Totally 60+ test cases are implemented for covering all positive and negative testing scenarios in this way.}
%\cvitem{}{\hspace*{1em}Some other test cases were automated through a Virtual Machine with Virtual PCI devices like \textit{vmxnet3} NIC cards and \textit{pvscsi} HBA adapters since we need to verify some model behaviors which will only happen at system booting stage. I also proposed several dummy test drivers for those virtual PCI devices.} \cvitem{}{\hspace*{1em}During this project, I went deep into both the native driver model as well as the \textit{VMKLinux} world, and through comparison of the two, I learned a lot on device and driver management.}
\cvitem{Objective}{Test the functionality of this model, including both API Whitebox and scenario testing.}

\cventry{\bfseries 04/2011--03/2012}{\textit{VMKernel Sysinfo Interface (VSI)} API Testing}{}{}{\textit{VMware}}{\textbf{Platform}: \textit{ESX/VMKernel} \hfill \textbf{Development Languages}: \textit{C/SHELL/SCons}}
\cvitem{}{VSI is an interface between the \textit{VMKernel} and userland. It serves a similar purpose to procfs on unix, but is more structured: all data is typed, enumerated, fixed size and statically defined at compile time.}
%\cvitem{}{\hspace*{1em}Essentially there are 2 differences for security and performance considerations comparing to procfs. First, instead of procfs' file ops kind userland interface, VSI provides userland C library interfaces a.k.a vsiCalls which is able to accept more structured data a.k.a vsiParams. So that validation of data input can be done in userland in advance where you can play safer with better performance. Second, VSI manages user implemented kernel level callbacks in VSI nodes and organize them in a tree-like structure, the layout of which can be statically determined at compiling stage. The tree is then statically linked to both kernel and the userland library, through which you can easily traverse the tree without touch kernel in a much faster manner. Beside that, VSI also provides various kinds of VSI Node prototypes for kernel/module developers, including plain leaf node, branch node, self-expandable branch node, and self-expandable leaf node etc.} 
%\cvitem{}{\hspace*{1em} Our testing objective is to verify the functionality and robustness of the overall VSI infrastructure. Simply saying, the functional test of VSI APIs is to test whether userland input can be delivered correctly through VSI to the target kernel land handler, and the result can be passed back to the userland caller. For security test, we also need to test all kinds of malicious inputs can be handled gracefully by those VSI APIs.}
%\cvitem{}{\hspace*{1em} There are 3 engineers on this project. I am the main test automation designer. During this project, I designed a handy testing framework based on CUnit which was then employed to be the standard testing framework to our whole team. I also designed the overall testing approach for verifying the functionality of VSI infrastructure. That approach is very simple that only 5 kernel handlers plus less than 10 VSI nodes are implemented in no more than 200 line C codes, but powerful enough for supporting our test on all types of VSI nodes and VSI APIs. By the end of this project, we implemented about 300 test cases, caught tens of critical bugs except for minor ones. Our test covered >90\% meaningful code paths of target VSI APIs.}
%\cvitem{}{\hspace*{1em} Except that, I also designed a memory checker for the VSI userland library. This checker is capable of detecting memory issues like memory leaks and duplicate free with little overhead. It can provide proficient runtime context for debugging convenience when hitting such issues, including detailed info of the memory chunk, the allocator, and backstrace info. As a result, this memory checker caught 2 memory leak bugs of VSI.}

\cvitem{}{ESXCLI is an unified command line tool for ESX management purpose. %Previously, there exist several standalone configuration tools for ESX which are implemented in various languages by different teams with uncontrollable quality. Then ESXCLI is proposed as a synthesized tool to replace all of them.
It is designed in an infrastructure/plugin fashion. Where plugin claim namespace, implement real management logics and register them as commands of the namespace into the infrastructure. While infrastructure manages namespaces/commands and provides an uniform way of launching them. A plugins could be C/C++ shared library %which implement infrastructure defined callbacks and do input/output using defined data structures. They 
which will be loaded with \textit{dlopen()} dynamically at runtime. It can also be an executable binary or script with XML manifest, % which describes its parameters/outputs/namespaces/commands/executions in the syntax defined by infrastructure. Those manifests will be loaded by the infrastructure which will then 
through which infrastructure could be able to know how to process its input/output uniformly and how to execute.}
%\cvitem{}{\hspace*{1em} We test the infrastructure. Our testing objective can be split to 2 parts. First APIs and data structures provided to plugins should be functionally right and reliable. Second, the infrastructure itself should be robust enough so that no malformed plugin can break it. We implemented about 240 test cases in total for this project, plus tens of native plugins and more than 100 XML plugins. With them, we caught more than 100 bugs of this product which expand from critical design defects to usability issues. That demonstrated the power and value of our testing. Our test achieved remarkable code coverage rate which is >95\%.}
%\cvitem{}{\hspace*{1em} There are 2 engineers on this project. I implemented 80\% of all test automations. At the early stage of this project, by only reading the source code, I found a critical issue on the design of this infrastructure, which finally made the implementer refactor his code. I also caught a code injection issue of the XML plugin that due to some escape characters were not handled correctly, it could break into shell and run arbitrary code. Due to my outstanding performance, on this project, I was even invited by the implementer to help fixing product bugs.}

We first re-divided modular function by orthogonal rule. Then we rewrote all modules in \textit{C}, and added state-of-the-art approaches for handling complex visual scenes. Performance of the completed part proved to be >30\%~faster, applicable in experiments, even comparable to mature products. Our team has 2 members.
